# Chrome_Venom

This is modification of the original code of https://github.com/hassaanaliw/chromepass and I have added the function def mail()

The original code just prints the google chrome passwords on the python IDE, so I add the function ok to store the output to a txt file and 
send It via email.

That means that If someone click the python script then the output will be sent to the email that he will press on the gmail_user global 
variable.

**DISCLAIMER**

I have no responsibility if someone acts irresponsible or against the law.

Thanks
